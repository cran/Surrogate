# Surrogate 3.2

## Surrogate 3.2.1

* Added `ICA.BinCont.BS()` function. This function allows for evaluating a 
continuous for a binary true endpoint in the information-theoretic causal 
inference framework. This function serves the same purpose as `ICA.BinCont()`,
but additionally allows for taking sampling variability into account.

## Surrogate 3.2.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
