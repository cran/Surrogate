\title{Fits a multivariate mixed-effects model to assess surrogacy in the meta-analytic multiple-trial setting (Continuous-continuous case with multiple surrogates)}
\description{
The function \code{MumixedContCont.MultS} uses the multivariate mixed-effects approach to estimate trial- and individual-level surrogacy when the data of multiple clinical trials are available and multiple surrogates are considered for a single true endpoint. See the \bold{Details} section below. 
}
\usage{
MumixedContCont.MultS(Dataset, Endpoints=True~Surr.1+Surr.2, 
Treat="Treat", Trial.ID="Trial.ID", Pat.ID="Pat.ID", 
Model=c("Full"), Min.Trial.Size=2, Alpha=.05, Opt="nlminb")
}
\arguments{
  \item{Dataset}{A \code{data.frame} that should consist of one line per patient. Each line contains one or more  surrogate value(s), a true endpoint value, a treatment indicator, a patient ID, and a trial ID.}
  \item{Endpoints}{An equation in the form \code{True~Surr.1+Surr.2} that specifies the true endpoint followed by the surrogate endpoint(s).}
  \item{Treat}{The name of the variable in \code{Dataset} that contains the treatment indicators. The treatment indicator should be coded as \eqn{1} for the experimental group and \eqn{-1} for the control group.}
  \item{Trial.ID}{The name of the variable in \code{Dataset} that contains the trial ID to which the patient belongs.}
  \item{Pat.ID}{The name of the variable in \code{Dataset} that contains the patient's ID.}
  \item{Model}{The type of model that should be fitted, i.e., \code{Model=c("Full")} or \code{Model=c("Reduced")}. For details, see below or Van der Elst \emph{et al.} (2023). 
  Default \code{Model=c("Full")}. }
  \item{Min.Trial.Size}{The minimum number of patients that a trial should contain in order to be included in the analysis. If the number of patients in a trial is smaller than the value specified by \code{Min.Trial.Size}, the data of the trial are excluded from the analysis. Default \eqn{2}.}
  \item{Alpha}{The \eqn{\alpha}-level that is used to determine the confidence intervals around \eqn{R^2_{trial}} and \eqn{R^2_{indiv}} (based on the approach of Lee, 1971). Default \eqn{0.05}.}
  \item{Opt}{The optimizer to be used by the \code{lme} function (the fits the mixed-effects model), with options \code{nlminb} or \code{optim}. For  details, see \code{?lmeControl}. Default \code{Opt="nlminb"}.}

}
\details{
When a full model is requested (by using the argument \code{Model=c("Full")} in the function call), the following mixed-effects model is fitted:

\deqn{S1_{ij}=\mu_{S1}+m_{S1i}(\alpha_{S1}+a_{S1i})Z_{ij}+\varepsilon_{S1ij},}
\deqn{S2_{ij}=\mu_{S2}+m_{S2i}(\alpha_{S2}+a_{S2i})Z_{ij}+\varepsilon_{S2ij},}
\deqn{SK_{ij}=\mu_{SK}+m_{SKi}(\alpha_{SK}+a_{SKi})Z_{ij}+\varepsilon_{SKij},}
\deqn{T_{ij}=\mu_{T}+m_{Ti}(\beta_{T}+b_{Ti})Z_{ij}+\varepsilon_{Tij},}

where \eqn{Z_{ij}} is the treatment indicator for subject \eqn{j} in trial \eqn{i}, 
\eqn{\mu_{S1}}, \eqn{\mu_{S2}}, ... \eqn{\mu_{SK}} and \eqn{\mu_{T}} are the fixed intercepts for \eqn{S1}, \eqn{S2}, ... \eqn{SK} and \eqn{T}, \eqn{m_{S1i}}, \eqn{m_{S2i}}, ... \eqn{m_{SKi}}, and \eqn{m_{Ti}} are the corresponding random intercepts, \eqn{\alpha_{S1}}, \eqn{\alpha_{S2}}, ..., \eqn{\alpha_{SK}} and \eqn{\beta_T} are the fixed treatment effects for \eqn{S1}, \eqn{S2}, ... \eqn{SK} and \eqn{T}, and \eqn{a_{S1i}}, \eqn{a_{S2i}}, ... \eqn{a_{SKi}} and \eqn{b_{Ti}} are the corresponding random treatment effects. The vector of the random effects \eqn{\left(m_{S1i},\:m_{S2i}, \: ... , \: m_{SKi},\: m_{Ti},\: a_{S1i},\: a_{S2i},\: ... , \: a_{SKi},\: b_{Ti}\right)} is assumed to be mean-zero normally distributed with unstructured variance-covariance matrix \eqn{\mathbf{D}}. Similarly, the residuals \eqn{\varepsilon_{S1ij}}, \eqn{\varepsilon_{S2ij}}, ... \eqn{\varepsilon_{SKij}},  \eqn{\varepsilon_{Tij}} are assumed to be mean-zero normally distributed with unstructured variance-covariance matrix \eqn{\mathbf{\Sigma}}.

When a reduced model is requested (by using the argument \code{Model=c("Reduced")} in the function call), the trial-specific intercepts for the surrogate endpoints and the true endpoint in the above model are replaced by common intercepts.

For the full model, \eqn{R^2_{trial}} and \eqn{R^2_{indiv}} are estimated based on \eqn{\mathbf{D}} and \eqn{\mathbf{\Sigma}}, respectively:
 \deqn{R_{trial}^{2}=R^2_{b_{Ti}|m_{S1i},\: m_{S2i},\: ..., \:m_{SKi}, \:  a_{S1i},\: a_{S2i}, \: ... \: a_{SKi}}=
\dfrac{\boldsymbol{D}_{ST}^T \: \boldsymbol{D}^{-1}_{SS} \: \boldsymbol{D}_{ST}}{\boldsymbol{D}_{TT}},}
\deqn{R_{indiv}^{2}=R_{\varepsilon_{Tij}|\varepsilon_{S1ij}, \: \varepsilon_{S2ij}, \: ..., \: \varepsilon_{SKij}}^{2}=
\dfrac{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{ST}^T \: \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1}_{SS} \: \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{ST}}{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{TT}}.}

For the reduced model, the reduced \eqn{\mathbf{D}} and \eqn{\mathbf{\Sigma}} are used.

\value{An object of class \code{MumixedContCont.MultS} with components,
  \item{Data.Analyze}{Prior to conducting the surrogacy analysis, data of patients who have a missing value for the surrogate and/or the true endpoint are excluded. In addition, the data of trials (i) in which only one type of the treatment was administered, and (ii) in which either the surrogate or the true endpoint was a constant are excluded. In addition, the user can specify the minimum number of patients that a trial should contain in order to include the trial in the analysis. If the number of patients in a trial is smaller than the value specified by \code{Min.Trial.Size}, the data of the trial are excluded. \code{Data.Analyze} is the dataset on which the surrogacy analysis was conducted.}
