\title{Fits (univariate) mixed-effect models to assess surrogacy in the continuous-continuous case based on the Information-Theoretic framework}
\description{
The function \code{MixedContContIT} uses the information-theoretic approach (Alonso & Molenberghs, 2007) to estimate trial- and individual-level surrogacy based on mixed-effect models when both S and T are continuous endpoints. The user can specify whether a (weighted or unweighted) full, semi-reduced, or reduced model should be fitted. See the \bold{Details} section below.   
}
\usage{
MixedContContIT(Dataset, Surr, True, Treat, Trial.ID, Pat.ID,
Model=c("Full"), Weighted=TRUE, Min.Trial.Size=2, Alpha=.05, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{Dataset}{A \code{data.frame} that should consist of one line per patient. Each line contains (at least) a surrogate value, a true endpoint value, a treatment indicator, a patient ID, and a trial ID.}
  \item{Surr}{The name of the variable in \code{Dataset} that contains the surrogate endpoint values.}
  \item{True}{The name of the variable in \code{Dataset} that contains the true endpoint values.}
  \item{Treat}{The name of the variable in \code{Dataset} that contains the treatment indicators. The treatment indicator should either be coded as \eqn{1} for the experimental group and \eqn{-1} for the control group, or as \eqn{1} for the experimental group and \eqn{0} for the control group. }
  \item{Trial.ID}{The name of the variable in \code{Dataset} that contains the trial ID to which the patient belongs.}
  \item{Pat.ID}{The name of the variable in \code{Dataset} that contains the patient's ID.}
  \item{Model}{The type of model that should be fitted, i.e., \code{Model=c("Full")}, \code{Model=c("Reduced")}, or \code{Model=c("SemiReduced")}. See the \bold{Details} section below. Default \code{Model=c("Full")}. }
\item{Weighted}{Logical. In practice it is often the case that different trials (or other clustering units) have different sample sizes. Univariate models are used to assess surrogacy in the information-theoretic approach, so it can be useful to adjust for heterogeneity in information content between the trial-specific contributions (particularly when trial-level surrogacy measures are of primary interest and when the heterogeneity in sample sizes is large). If \code{Weighted=TRUE}, weighted regression models are fitted. If \code{Weighted=FALSE}, unweighted regression analyses are conducted. See the \bold{Details} section below. Default \code{TRUE}.}
\item{Min.Trial.Size}{The minimum number of patients that a trial should contain to be included in the analysis. If the number of patients in a trial is smaller than the value specified by \code{Min.Trial.Size}, the data of the trial are excluded from the analysis. Default \eqn{2}.}
  \item{Alpha}{The \eqn{\alpha}-level that is used to determine the confidence intervals around \eqn{R^2_{h}} and \eqn{R^2_{ht}}. Default \eqn{0.05}.}
  \item{\dots}{Other arguments to be passed to the function \code{lmer} (of the R package \code{lme4}) that is used to fit the geralized linear mixed-effect models in the function \code{BimixedContCont}.}

\details{

\emph{Individual-level surrogacy}

The following generalised linear mixed-effect models are fitted:

\deqn{g_{T}(E(T_{ij}))=\mu_{T}+m_{Ti}+\beta Z_{ij}+b_{i}Z_{ij},}
\deqn{g_{T}(E(T_{ij}|S_{ij}))=\theta_{0}+c_{Ti}+\theta_{1}Z_{ij}+a_{i}Z_{ij}+\theta_{2i}S_{ij},}

where \eqn{i} and \eqn{j} are the trial and subject indicators, \eqn{g_{T}} is an appropriate link function (i.e., an identity link when a continuous true endpoint is considered), \eqn{S_{ij}} and \eqn{T_{ij}} are the surrogate and true endpoint values of subject \eqn{j} in trial \eqn{i}, and \eqn{Z_{ij}} is the treatment indicator for subject \eqn{j} in trial \eqn{i}. \eqn{\mu_{T}} and \eqn{\beta} are a fixed intercept and a fixed treatment-effect on the true endpoint, while \eqn{m_{Ti}} and \eqn{b_{i}} are the corresponding random effects. \eqn{\theta_{0}} and \eqn{\theta_{1}} are the fixed intercept and the fixed treatment effect on the true endpoint after accounting for the effect of the surrogate endpoint, and \eqn{c_{Ti}} and \eqn{a_i} are the corresponding random effects. 

The \eqn{-2} log likelihood values of the previous models (i.e., \eqn{L_{1}} and \eqn{L_{2}}, respectively) are subsequently used to compute individual-level surrogacy (based on the so-called Variance Reduction Factor, VFR; for details, see Alonso & Molenberghs, 2007):

\deqn{R^2_{hind}= 1 - exp \left(-\frac{L_{2}-L_{1}}{N} \right),}

where \eqn{N} is the number of trials.



\emph{Trial-level surrogacy}

When a full or semi-reduced model is requested (by using the argument \code{Model=c("Full")} or \code{Model=c("SemiReduced")} in the function call), trial-level surrogacy is assessed by fitting the following mixed models: 

\deqn{S_{ij}=\mu_{S}+m_{Si}+(\alpha+a_{i})Z_{ij}+\varepsilon_{Sij},   (1)}
\deqn{T_{ij}=\mu_{T}+m_{Ti}+(\beta+b_{i})Z_{ij}+\varepsilon_{Tij},   (1)} 

where \eqn{i} and \eqn{j} are the trial and subject indicators, \eqn{S_{ij}} and \eqn{T_{ij}} are the surrogate and true endpoint values of subject \eqn{j} in trial \eqn{i}, \eqn{Z_{ij}} is the treatment indicator for subject \eqn{j} in trial \eqn{i}, \eqn{\mu_{S}} and \eqn{\mu_{T}} are the fixed intercepts for S and T, \eqn{m_{Si}} and \eqn{m_{Ti}} are the corresponding random intercepts,  \eqn{\alpha} and \eqn{\beta} are the fixed treatment effects on S and T, and \eqn{a_{i}} and \eqn{b_{i}} are the corresponding random effects. The error terms \eqn{\varepsilon_{Sij}} and \eqn{\varepsilon_{Tij}} are assumed to be independent.

When a reduced model is requested by the user (by using the argument \code{Model=c("Reduced")} in the function call), the following univariate models are fitted:

\deqn{S_{ij}=\mu_{S}+(\alpha+a_{i})Z_{ij}+\varepsilon_{Sij},   (2)}
\deqn{T_{ij}=\mu_{T}+(\beta+b_{i})Z_{ij}+\varepsilon_{Tij},   (2)}

where \eqn{\mu_{S}} and \eqn{\mu_{T}} are the common intercepts for S and T. The other parameters are the same as defined above, and \eqn{\varepsilon_{Sij}} and \eqn{\varepsilon_{Tij}} are again assumed to be independent.

When the user requested that a full model approach is used (by using the argument \code{Model=c("Full")} in the function call, i.e., when models (1) were fitted), the following model is subsequently fitted:

\deqn{\widehat{\beta}_{i}=\lambda_{0}+\lambda_{1}\widehat{\mu_{Si}}+\lambda_{2}\widehat{\alpha_i}+\varepsilon_{i},   (3)}

where the parameter estimates for \eqn{\beta_i}, \eqn{\mu_{Si}}, and \eqn{\alpha_i} are based on models (1) (see above).  When a weighted model is requested (using the argument \code{Weighted=TRUE} in the function call), model (3) is a weighted regression model (with weights based on the number of observations in trial \eqn{i}). The \eqn{-2} log likelihood value of the (weighted or unweighted) models (3) (\eqn{L_1}) is subsequently compared to the \eqn{-2} log likelihood value of an intercept-only model (\eqn{\widehat{\beta}_{i}=\lambda_{3}}; \eqn{L_0}), and \eqn{R^2_{ht}} is computed based on the Variance Reduction Factor (VFR; for details, see Alonso & Molenberghs, 2007):

\deqn{R^2_{ht}= 1 - exp \left(-\frac{L_1-L_0}{N} \right),}

where \eqn{N} is the number of trials. 

When a semi-reduced or reduced model is requested (by using the argument \code{Model=c("SemiReduced")} or \code{Model=c("Reduced")} in the function call), the following model is fitted:

\deqn{\widehat{\beta_{i}}=\lambda_{0}+\lambda_{1}\widehat{\alpha_i}+\varepsilon_{i},}

where the parameter estimates for \eqn{\beta_i} and \eqn{\alpha_i} are based on models (2). The \eqn{-2} log likelihood value of this (weighted or unweighted) model (\eqn{L_1}) is subsequently compared to the \eqn{-2} log likelihood value of an intercept-only model (\eqn{\widehat{\beta}_{i}=\lambda_{3}}; \eqn{L_0}), and \eqn{R^2_{ht}} is computed based on the reduction in the likelihood (as described above).

If the number of patients in a trial is smaller than the value specified by \code{Min.Trial.Size}, the data of the trial are excluded. \code{Data.Analyze} is the dataset on which the surrogacy analysis was conducted.}
