\title{Evaluate the individual causal association (ICA) and reduction in probability of a prediction error (RPE) in the setting where both \eqn{S} and \eqn{T} are binary endpoints}
\description{
The function \code{PROC.BinBin} assesses the ICA and RPE in the single-trial causal-inference framework when both the surrogate and the true endpoints are binary outcomes. It additionally allows to account for sampling variability by means of bootstrap. See \bold{Details} below.}
\usage{
PROC.BinBin(Dataset=Dataset, Surr=Surr, True=True, Treat=Treat, 
BS=FALSE, seqs=250, MC_samples=1000, Seed=1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{Dataset}{A \code{data.frame} that should consist of one line per patient. Each line contains (at least) a binary surrogate value, a binary true endpoint value, and a treatment indicator. }
  \item{Surr}{The name of the variable in \code{Dataset} that contains the binary surrogate endpoint values. Should be coded as \eqn{0} and \eqn{1}.}
  \item{True}{The name of the variable in \code{Dataset} that contains the binary true endpoint values. Should be coded as \eqn{0} and \eqn{1}.}
  \item{Treat}{The name of the variable in \code{Dataset} that contains the treatment indicators. The treatment indicator should be coded as \eqn{1} for the experimental group and \eqn{-1} for the control group. }
   \item{BS}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then Dataset will be bootstrapped to account for sampling variability. If \code{FALSE}, then no bootstrap is performed. See the \bold{Details} section below. Default \code{FALSE}. }
  \item{seqs}{The number of copies of the dataset that are produced or alternatively the number of bootstrap datasets that are produced. Default \code{seqs=250}. }
   \item{MC_samples}{The number of Monte Carlo samples that need to be obtained per copy of the data set. Default \code{MC_samples=1000}. }
  \item{Seed}{The seed to be used. Default \code{Seed=1}.}

\details{

In the continuous normal setting, surroagacy can be assessed by studying the association between the individual causal effects on \eqn{S} and \eqn{T} (see \code{\link{ICA.ContCont}}). In that setting, the Pearson correlation is the obvious measure of association.

When \eqn{S} and \eqn{T} are binary endpoints, multiple alternatives exist. Alonso et al. (2016) proposed the individual causal association (ICA; \eqn{R_{H}^{2}}), which captures the association between the individual causal effects of the treatment on \eqn{S} (\eqn{\Delta_S}) and \eqn{T} (\eqn{\Delta_T}) using information-theoretic principles. 

The function \code{PPE.BinBin} computes \eqn{R_{H}^{2}} using a grid-based approach where all possible combinations of the specified grids for the parameters that are allowed to vary freely are considered. It additionally computes the minimal probability of a prediction error (PPE) and the reduction on the PPE using information that \eqn{S} conveys on \eqn{T} (RPE). Both measures provide complementary information over the \eqn{R_{H}^{2}} and facilitate more straightforward clinical interpretation. No assumption about monotonicity can be made. The function \code{PROC.BinBin} makes direct use of the function \code{PPE.BinBin}. However, it is computationally much faster thanks to equally dividing the number of Monte Carlo samples over copies of the input data. In addition, it allows to account for sampling variability using a bootstrap procedure. Finally, the function \code{PROC.BinBin} computes the marginal probabilities directly from the input data set.
