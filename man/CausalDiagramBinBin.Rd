\title{
Draws a causal diagram depicting the median informational coefficients of correlation (or odds ratios) between the counterfactuals for a specified range of values of the ICA in the binary-binary setting.
}
\description{
This function provides a diagram that depicts the medians of the informational coefficients of correlation (or odds ratios) between the counterfactuals for a specified range of values of the individual causal association in the binary-binary setting (\eqn{R_{H}^{2}}). 
}
\usage{
CausalDiagramBinBin(x, Values="Corrs", Theta_T0S0, Theta_T1S1, 
Min=0, Max=1, Cex.Letters=3, Cex.Corrs=2, Lines.Rel.Width=TRUE, 
Col.Pos.Neg=TRUE, Monotonicity, Histograms.Correlations=FALSE, 
Densities.Correlations=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{An object of class \code{ICA.BinBin}. See \code{\link{ICA.BinBin}}.}
  \item{Values}{Specifies whether the median informational coefficients of correlation or median odds ratios between the counterfactuals should be depicted, i.e., \code{Values="Corrs"} or \code{Values="ORs"}.}
\item{Theta_T0S0}{The odds ratio between \eqn{T} and \eqn{S} in the control group. This quantity is estimable based on the observed data. Only has to be provided when \code{Values="ORs"}.}
  \item{Theta_T1S1}{The odds ratio between \eqn{T} and \eqn{S} in the experimental treatment group. This quantity is estimable based on the observed data. Only has to be provided when \code{Values="ORs"}.}
  \item{Min}{The minimum value of \eqn{R_{H}^{2}} that should be considered. Default=\eqn{-1}.}
  \item{Max}{The maximum value of \eqn{R_{H}^{2}} that should be considered. Default=\eqn{1}.}
  \item{Cex.Letters}{The size of the symbols for the counterfactuals (\eqn{S_0}, \eqn{S_1}), \eqn{T_0}, \eqn{T_1}). Default=\eqn{3}.}
  \item{Cex.Corrs}{The size of the text depicting the median odds ratios between the counterfactuals. Default=\eqn{2}.}
  \item{Lines.Rel.Width}{Logical. When \code{Lines.Rel.Width=TRUE}, the widths of the lines that represent the odds ratios between the counterfactuals are relative to the size of the odds ratios (i.e., a smaller/thicker line is used for smaller/higher odds ratios. When \code{Lines.Rel.Width=FALSE}, the width of all lines representing the odds ratios between the counterfactuals is identical. Default=\code{TRUE}.  Only considered when \code{Values="ORs"}.}
  \item{Col.Pos.Neg}{Logical. When \code{Col.Pos.Neg=TRUE}, the color of the lines that represent the odds ratios between the counterfactuals is red for odds ratios below \eqn{1} and black for the ones above \eqn{1}. When \code{Col.Pos.Neg=FALSE}, all lines are in black. Default=\code{TRUE}. Only considered when \code{Values="ORs"}.}
\item{Monotonicity}{Specifies the monotonicity scenario that should be considered (i.e., \code{Monotonicity=c("No")}, \code{Monotonicity=c("True.Endp")}, \code{Monotonicity=c("Surr.Endp")}, or \code{Monotonicity=c("Surr.True.Endp")}).}
\item{Histograms.Correlations}{Should histograms of the informational coefficients of association \eqn{R_{H}^{2}} be provided? Default \code{Histograms.Correlations=FALSE}.}
\item{Densities.Correlations}{Should densities of the informational coefficients of association \eqn{R_{H}^{2}} be provided? Default \code{Densities.Correlations=FALSE}.}
}
\value{The following components are stored in the fitted object if histograms of the informational correlations are requested in the function call (i.e., if \code{Histograms.Correlations=TRUE} and \code{Values="Corrs"} in the function call):
\item{R2_H_T0T1}{The informational coefficients of association \eqn{R_{H}^{2}} between \eqn{T_0} and \eqn{T_1}.}
\item{R2_H_S1T0}{The informational coefficients of association \eqn{R_{H}^{2}} between \eqn{S_1} and \eqn{T_0}.}
\item{R2_H_S0T1}{The informational coefficients of association \eqn{R_{H}^{2}} between \eqn{S_0} and \eqn{T_1}.}
\item{R2_H_S0S1}{The informational coefficients of association \eqn{R_{H}^{2}} between \eqn{S_0} and \eqn{S_1}.}
\item{R2_H_S0T0}{The informational coefficients of association \eqn{R_{H}^{2}} between \eqn{S_0} and \eqn{T_0}.}
\item{R2_H_S1T1}{The informational coefficients of association \eqn{R_{H}^{2}} between \eqn{S_1} and \eqn{T_1}.}
