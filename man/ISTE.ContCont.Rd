\title{Individual-level surrogate threshold effect for continuous normally distributed surrogate and true endpoints.}
\description{Computes the individual-level surrogate threshold effect in the causal-inference single-trial setting where both the surrogate and the true endpoint are continuous normally distributed variables. For details, see paper in the references section.}

\arguments{
\item{Mean_T1}{A scalar or vector that specifies the mean of the true endpoint in the experimental treatment condition (a vector is used to account for estimation uncertainty).}
\item{Mean_T0}{A scalar or vector that specifies the mean of the true endpoint in the control condition (a vector is used to account for estimation uncertainty).}
\item{Mean_S1}{A scalar or vector that specifies the mean of the surrogate endpoint in the experimental treatment condition (a vector is used to account for estimation uncertainty).}
\item{Mean_S0}{A scalar or vector that specifies the mean of the surrogate endpoint in the control condition (a vector is used to account for estimation uncertainty).}
\item{N}{The sample size of the clinical trial.}
\item{Delta_S}{The vector or scalar of \eqn{\Delta S} values for which the expected \eqn{\Delta T} and its prediction error has to be computed.}
\item{zeta.PI}{The alpha-level to be used in the computation of the prediction interval around \eqn{E(\Delta T)}. Default \code{zeta.PI=0.05}, i.e., the \eqn{95\%} prediction interval.}
\item{PI.Bound}{The ISTE is defined as the value of \eqn{\Delta S} for which the lower (or upper) bound of the \eqn{(1-\alpha)\%} prediction interval around \eqn{E(\Delta T)} is 0. If another threshold value than 0 is desired, this can be requested by using the \code{PI.Bound} argument. For example, the argument \code{PI.Bound=5} can be used in the function call to obtain the values of \eqn{\Delta S} for which the lower (or upper) bound of the \eqn{(1-\alpha)\%} prediction intervals (in the different runs of the algorithm)around \eqn{\Delta T} equal 5.}
\item{PI.Lower}{Logical. Should a lower (\code{PI.Lower=TRUE}) or upper (\code{PI.Lower=FALSE}) prediction interval be used in the computation of ISTE? Default \code{PI.Lower=TRUE}.}
\item{Show.Prediction.Plots}{Logical. Should plots that depict \eqn{E(\Delta T)} against \eqn{\Delta S} (prediction function), the prediction interval, and the ISTE for the different runs of the algorithm be shown? Default \code{Show.Prediction.Plots=TRUE}.}
\item{Save.Plots}{Should the prediction plots (see previous item) be saved? If \code{Save.Plots="No"} is used (the default argument), the plots are not saved. If the plots have to be saved, replace \code{"No"} by the desired location, e.g., \code{Save.Plots="C:/Analysis directory/"} on a windows computer or \code{Save.Plots="/Users/wim/Desktop/Analysis directory/"} on macOS or Linux.} 
\item{T0S0}{A scalar or vector that specifies the correlation(s) between the surrogate and the true endpoint in the control treatment condition that should be considered in the computation of ISTE.}
\item{T1S1}{A scalar or vector that specifies the correlation(s) between the surrogate and the true endpoint in the experimental treatment condition that should be considered in the computation of ISTE.}
\item{T0T0}{A scalar that specifies the variance of the true endpoint in the control treatment condition that should be considered in the computation of ISTE. Default 1.}

\item{S1S1}{A scalar that specifies the variance of the surrogate endpoint in the experimental treatment condition that should be considered in the computation of ISTE. Default 1.}
\item{T0T1}{A scalar or vector that contains the correlation(s) between the counterfactuals T0 and T1 that should be considered in the computation of ISTE. Default \code{seq(-1, 1, by=.001)}.}
\item{T0S1}{A scalar or vector that contains the correlation(s) between the counterfactuals T0 and S1 that should be considered in the computation of ISTE. Default \code{seq(-1, 1, by=.001)}.}

\item{S0S1}{A scalar or vector that contains the correlation(s) between the counterfactuals S0 and S1 that should be considered in the computation of ISTE. Default \code{seq(-1, 1, by=.001)}.}
\item{M.PosDef}{The number of positive definite \eqn{\Sigma} matrices that should be identified. This will also determine the amount of ISTE values that are identified. Default \code{M.PosDef=500}.}
\item{Seed}{The seed to be used in the analysis (for reproducibility). Default \code{Seed=123}.}
