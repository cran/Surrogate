Longitudinal PANSS data of five clinical trials in schizophrenia
}
\description{
These are the longitudinal PANSS data of five clinical trial in schizophrenia. A total of \eqn{2151} patients were treated by \eqn{198} investiagators (psychiatrists). There were two treatment conditions (risperidone and control). Patients' schizophrenic symptoms were measured using the PANSS at different time moments following start of the treatment. The variables Week1-Week8 express the change scores over time using the raw (semi-continuous) PANSS scores. The variables Week1_bin - Week8_bin are binary indicators of a \eqn{20}\% or higher reduction in PANSS score versus baseline. The latter corresponds to a commonly accepted criterion for defining a clinically meaningful response (Kay et al., 1988).}
