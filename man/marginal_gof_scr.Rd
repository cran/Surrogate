\title{Marginal survival function goodness of fit}
\usage{
marginal_gof_scr(fitted_model, data, grid, time_unit = "years")
}
\arguments{
\item{fitted_model}{Returned value from \code{\link[=fit_model_SurvSurv]{fit_model_SurvSurv()}}. This object
essentially contains the estimated identifiable part of the joint
distribution for the potential outcomes.}

\item{data}{data that was supplied to \code{\link[=fit_model_SurvSurv]{fit_model_SurvSurv()}}.}

\item{grid}{grid of time-points for which to compute the estimated survival
functions.}

\item{time_unit}{character vector that reflects the time unit of the
endpoints, defaults to \code{"years"}.}
}
\description{
The \code{\link[=marginal_gof_scr]{marginal_gof_scr()}} function plots the estimated marginal survival
functions for the fitted model. This results in four plots of survival
functions, one for each of \eqn{S_0}, \eqn{S_1}, \eqn{T_0}, \eqn{T_1}.
