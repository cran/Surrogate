Fits a bivariate mixed-effects model using the cluster-by-cluster (CbC) estimator to assess surrogacy in the meta-analytic multiple-trial setting  (Continuous-continuous case)}
\description{
The function \code{BimixedCbCContCont} uses the cluster-by-cluster (CbC) estimator of the bivariate mixed-effects to estimate trial- and individual-level surrogacy when the data of multiple clinical trials are available. See the \bold{Details} section below.  
}
\usage{
BimixedCbCContCont(Dataset, Surr, True, Treat, Trial.ID,Min.Treat.Size=2,Alpha=0.05)
}
\arguments{
  \item{Dataset}{A \code{data.frame} that should consist of one line per patient. Each line contains (at least) a surrogate value, a true endpoint value, a treatment indicator, and a trial ID.}
  \item{Surr}{The name of the variable in \code{Dataset} that contains the surrogate endpoint values.}
  \item{True}{The name of the variable in \code{Dataset} that contains the true endpoint values.}
  \item{Treat}{The name of the variable in \code{Dataset} that contains the treatment indicators. The treatment indicator should either be coded as \eqn{1} for the experimental group and \eqn{-1} for the control group, or as \eqn{1} for the experimental group and \eqn{0} for the control group.}
  \item{Trial.ID}{The name of the variable in \code{Dataset} that contains the trial ID to which the patient belongs.}
  \item{Min.Treat.Size}{The minimum number of patients in each group (control or experimental) that a trial should contain to be included in the analysis. If the number of patients in a group of a trial is smaller than the value specified by \code{Min.Treat.Size}, the data of the trial are excluded from the analysis. Default \eqn{2}.}
    \item{Alpha}{The \eqn{\alpha}-level that is used to determine the confidence intervals around \eqn{R^2_{trial}} and \eqn{R^2_{indiv}}. Default \eqn{0.05}.}

\details{
The function \code{BimixedContCont} fits a bivariate mixed-effects model using the CbC estimator (for details, see Florez et al., 2019) to assess surrogacy (for details, see Buyse et al., 2000). In particular, the following mixed-effects model is fitted: 

\deqn{S_{ij}=\mu_{S}+m_{Si}+(\alpha+a_{i})Z_{ij}+\varepsilon_{Sij},}
\deqn{T_{ij}=\mu_{T}+m_{Ti}+(\beta+b_{i})Z_{ij}+\varepsilon_{Tij},} 

where \eqn{i} and \eqn{j} are the trial and subject indicators, \eqn{S_{ij}} and \eqn{T_{ij}} are the surrogate and true endpoint values of subject \eqn{j} in trial \eqn{i}, \eqn{Z_{ij}} is the treatment indicator for subject \eqn{j} in trial \eqn{i}, \eqn{\mu_{S}} and \eqn{\mu_{T}} are the fixed intercepts for S and T, \eqn{m_{Si}} and \eqn{m_{Ti}} are the corresponding random intercepts, \eqn{\alpha} and \eqn{\beta} are the fixed treatment effects for S and T, and \eqn{a_{i}} and \eqn{b_{i}} are the corresponding random treatment effects, respectively. 

The vector of the random effects (i.e., \eqn{m_{Si}}, \eqn{m_{Ti}}, \eqn{a_{i}} and \eqn{b_{i}}) is assumed to be mean-zero normally distributed with variance-covariance matrix \eqn{\bold{D}}:

\deqn{\bold{D}=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
d_{SS}\\
d_{ST} & d_{TT}\\
d_{Sa} & d_{Ta} & d_{aa}\\
d_{Sb} & d_{Tb} & d_{ab} & d_{bb}
\end{array}\right).}
 
The trial-level coefficient of determination (i.e., \eqn{R^2_{trial}}) is quantified as:

\deqn{R_{trial}^{2}=\frac{\left(\begin{array}{c}
d_{Sb}\\
d_{ab}
\end{array}\right)^{'}\left(\begin{array}{cc}
d_{SS} & d_{Sa}\\
d_{Sa} & d_{aa}
\end{array}\right)^{-1}\left(\begin{array}{c}
d_{Sb}\\
d_{ab}
\end{array}\right)}{d_{bb}}.}
 
The error terms \eqn{\varepsilon_{Sij}} and \eqn{\varepsilon_{Tij}} are assumed to be mean-zero normally distributed with variance-covariance matrix \eqn{\bold{\Sigma}}: 

\deqn{\bold{\Sigma}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}\sigma_{SS}\\\sigma_{ST} & \sigma_{TT}\end{array}\right).} 

Based on \eqn{\bold{\Sigma}}, individual-level surrogacy is quantified as: 

\deqn{R_{indiv}^{2}=\frac{\sigma_{ST}^{2}}{\sigma_{SS}\sigma_{TT}}.} 

\bold{\emph{Note}}
The CbC estimator for the full bivariate mixed-effects model is closed-form (for details, see Florez et al., 2019). Therefore, it is fast. Furthermore, it is recommended when computational issues occur with the full maximum likelihood estimator (implemented in function \code{BimixedContCont}). 

The CbC estimator is performed in two stages: (1) a linear model is fitted in each trial. Evidently, it is require that the design matrix (\eqn{X_i}) is full column rank within each trial, allowing estimation of the fixed effects. When \eqn{X_i} is not full rank, trial i is excluded from the analysis. (2) a global estimator of the fixed effects (\eqn{\beta}) is obtained by weighted averaging the sets of estimates of each trial, and \eqn{\bold{D}} is estimated using a method-of-moments estimator. Optimal weights (for details, see Molenberghs et al., 2018) are used as a weighting scheme. 

The estimator of \eqn{\bold{D}} might lead to a non-positive-definite solution. Therefore, the eigenvalue method (for details, see Rousseeuw and Molenberghs, 1993) is used for non-positive-definiteness adjustment.
