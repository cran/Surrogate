\details{
Based on the causal-inference framework, it is assumed that each subject \emph{j} has four counterfactuals (or potential outcomes), i.e., \eqn{T_{0j}}, \eqn{T_{1j}}, \eqn{S_{0j}}, and \eqn{S_{1j}}. Let \eqn{T_{0j}} and \eqn{T_{1j}} denote the counterfactuals for the true endpoint (\eqn{T}) under the control (\eqn{Z=0}) and the experimental (\eqn{Z=1}) treatments of subject \emph{j}, respectively. Similarly, \eqn{S_{0j}} and \eqn{S_{1j}} denote the corresponding counterfactuals for the surrogate endpoint (\eqn{S}) under the control and experimental treatments, respectively. The individual causal effects of \eqn{Z} on \eqn{T} and \eqn{S} for a given subject \emph{j} are then defined as \eqn{\Delta_{T_{j}}=T_{1j}-T_{0j}} and \eqn{\Delta_{S_{j}}=S_{1j}-S_{0j}}, respectively.

In the single-trial causal-inference framework, surrogacy can be quantified as the correlation between the individual causal effects of \eqn{Z} on \eqn{S} and \eqn{T} (for details, see Alonso et al., submitted):

\deqn{\rho_{\Delta}=\rho(\Delta_{T_{j}},\:\Delta_{S_{j}})=\frac{\sqrt{\sigma_{S_{0}S_{0}}\sigma_{T_{0}T_{0}}}\rho_{S_{0}T_{0}}+\sqrt{\sigma_{S_{1}S_{1}}\sigma_{T_{1}T_{1}}}\rho_{S_{1}T_{1}}-\sqrt{\sigma_{S_{0}S_{0}}\sigma_{T_{1}T_{1}}}\rho_{S_{0}T_{1}}-\sqrt{\sigma_{S_{1}S_{1}}\sigma_{T_{0}T_{0}}}\rho_{S_{1}T_{0}}}{\sqrt{(\sigma_{T_{0}T_{0}}+\sigma_{T_{1}T_{1}}-2\sqrt{\sigma_{T_{0}T_{0}}\sigma_{T_{1}T_{1}}}\rho_{T_{0}T_{1}})(\sigma_{S_{0}S_{0}}+\sigma_{S_{1}S_{1}}-2\sqrt{\sigma_{S_{0}S_{0}}\sigma_{S_{1}S_{1}}}\rho_{S_{0}S_{1}})}},} 

where the correlations \eqn{\rho_{S_{0}T_{1}}}, \eqn{\rho_{S_{1}T_{0}}}, \eqn{\rho_{T_{0}T_{1}}}, and \eqn{\rho_{S_{0}S_{1}}} are not estimable. It is thus warranted to conduct a sensitivity analysis (by considering vectors of possible values for the correlations between the counterfactuals -- rather than point estimates). 

When the user specifies a vector of values that should be considered for one or more of the counterfactual correlations in the above expression, the function \code{ICA.ContCont} constructs all possible matrices that can be formed as based on these values, identifies the matrices that are positive definite (i.e., valid correlation matrices), and computes \eqn{\rho_{\Delta}} for each of these matrices. The obtained vector of \eqn{\rho_{\Delta}} values can subsequently be used to examine (i) the impact of different assumptions regarding the correlations between the counterfactuals on the results (see also \code{\link{plot Causal-Inference ContCont}}), and (ii) the extent to which proponents of the causal-inference and meta-analytic frameworks will reach the same conclusion with respect to the appropriateness of the candidate surrogate at hand.   

The function \code{ICA.ContCont} also generates output that is useful to examine the plausibility of finding a good surrogate endpoint (see \code{GoodSurr} in the \bold{Value} section below). For details, see Alonso et al. (submitted).


\bold{Notes}

A single \eqn{\rho_{\Delta}} value is obtained when all correlations in the function call are scalars.
