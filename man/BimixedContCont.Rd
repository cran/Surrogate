\title{
Fits a bivariate mixed-effects model to assess surrogacy in the meta-analytic multiple-trial setting 
(Continuous-continuous case)}
\description{
The function \code{BimixedContCont} uses the bivariate mixed-effects approach to estimate trial- and individual-level surrogacy when the data of multiple clinical trials are available. The user can specify whether a full or reduced model should be fitted. See the \bold{Details} section below.  Further, the Individual Causal Association (ICA) is computed.

}
\details{
The function \code{BimixedContCont} fits a bivariate mixed-effects model to assess surrogacy (for details, see Buyse et al., 2000). In particular, the following mixed-effects model is fitted: 

\deqn{S_{ij}=\mu_{S}+m_{Si}+(\alpha+a_{i})Z_{ij}+\varepsilon_{Sij},}
\deqn{T_{ij}=\mu_{T}+m_{Ti}+(\beta+b_{i})Z_{ij}+\varepsilon_{Tij},} 

where \eqn{i} and \eqn{j} are the trial and subject indicators, \eqn{S_{ij}} and \eqn{T_{ij}} are the surrogate and true endpoint values of subject \eqn{j} in trial \eqn{i}, \eqn{Z_{ij}} is the treatment indicator for subject \eqn{j} in trial \eqn{i}, \eqn{\mu_{S}} and \eqn{\mu_{T}} are the fixed intercepts for S and T, \eqn{m_{Si}} and \eqn{m_{Ti}} are the corresponding random intercepts, \eqn{\alpha} and \eqn{\beta} are the fixed treatment effects for S and T, and \eqn{a_{i}} and \eqn{b_{i}} are the corresponding random treatment effects, respectively. 

The vector of the random effects (i.e., \eqn{m_{Si}}, \eqn{m_{Ti}}, \eqn{a_{i}} and \eqn{b_{i}}) is assumed to be mean-zero normally distributed with variance-covariance matrix \eqn{\bold{D}}:

\deqn{\bold{D}=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
d_{SS}\\
d_{ST} & d_{TT}\\
d_{Sa} & d_{Ta} & d_{aa}\\
d_{Sb} & d_{Tb} & d_{ab} & d_{bb}
\end{array}\right).}
 
The trial-level coefficient of determination (i.e., \eqn{R^2_{trial}}) is quantified as:

\deqn{R_{trial}^{2}=\frac{\left(\begin{array}{c}
d_{Sb}\\
d_{ab}
\end{array}\right)^{'}\left(\begin{array}{cc}
d_{SS} & d_{Sa}\\
d_{Sa} & d_{aa}
\end{array}\right)^{-1}\left(\begin{array}{c}
d_{Sb}\\
d_{ab}
\end{array}\right)}{d_{bb}}.}
 
The error terms \eqn{\varepsilon_{Sij}} and \eqn{\varepsilon_{Tij}} are assumed to be mean-zero normally distributed with variance-covariance matrix \eqn{\bold{\Sigma}}: 

\deqn{\bold{\Sigma}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}\sigma_{SS}\\\sigma_{ST} & \sigma_{TT}\end{array}\right).} 

Based on \eqn{\bold{\Sigma}}, individual-level surrogacy is quantified as: 

\deqn{R_{indiv}^{2}=\frac{\sigma_{ST}^{2}}{\sigma_{SS}\sigma_{TT}}.} 

\bold{\emph{Note}}

When the full bivariate mixed-effects approach is used to assess surrogacy in the meta-analytic framework (for details, see Buyse & Molenberghs, 2000), computational issues often occur. Such problems mainly occur when the number of trials is low, the number of patients in the different trials is low, and/or when the trial-level heterogeneity is small (Burzykowski et al., 2000). 

In that situation, the use of a simplified model-fitting strategy may be warranted (for details, see Burzykowski et al., 2000; Tibaldi et al., 2003).

For example, a reduced bivariate-mixed effect model can be fitted instead of a full model (by using the \code{Model=c("Reduced")} argument in the function call). In the reduced model, the random-effects structure is simplified (i) by assuming that there is no heterogeneity in the random intercepts, or (ii) by assuming that the covariance between the random intercepts and random treatment effects is zero. Note that under this assumption, the computation of the trial-level coefficient of determination (i.e., \eqn{R^2_{trial}}) simplifies to: 

\deqn{R_{trial}^{2}=\frac{d_{ab}^{2}}{d_{aa}d_{bb}}.}
 
Alternatively, the bivariate mixed-effects model may be abandonned and the user may fit a univariate fixed-effects model, a bivariate fixed-effects model, or a univariate mixed-effects model (for details, see Tibaldi et al., 2003). These models are implemented in the functions \code{\link{UnifixedContCont}}, \code{\link{BifixedContCont}}, and \code{\link{UnimixedContCont}}).

\value{An object of class \code{BimixedContCont} with components,
  \item{Data.Analyze}{Prior to conducting the surrogacy analysis, data of patients who have a missing value for the surrogate and/or the true endpoint are excluded. In addition, the data of trials (i) in which only one type of the treatment was administered, and (ii) in which either the surrogate or the true endpoint was a constant (i.e., all patients within a trial had the same surrogate and/or true endpoint value) are excluded. In addition, the user can specify the minimum number of patients that a trial should contain in order to include the trial in the analysis. If the number of patients in a trial is smaller than the value specified by \code{Min.Trial.Size}, the data of the trial are excluded. \code{Data.Analyze} is the dataset on which the surrogacy analysis was conducted.}
