Data of the Age-Related Macular Degeneration Study
}
\description{
These are the data of a clinical trial involving patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), a condition that involves a progressive loss of vision. A total of \eqn{181} patients from \eqn{36} centers participated in the trial. Patients' visual acuity was assessed using standardized vision charts. There were two treatment conditions (placebo and interferon-\eqn{\alpha}). The potential surrogate endpoint is the change in the visual acuity at \eqn{24} weeks (\eqn{6} months) after starting treatment. The true endpoint is the change in the visual acuity at \eqn{52} weeks.}

    \item{\code{Id}}{The Patient ID.}
    \item{\code{Center}}{The center in which the patient was treated.}
    \item{\code{Treat}}{The treatment indicator, coded as \eqn{-1} = placebo and \eqn{1} = interferon-\eqn{\alpha}.}
