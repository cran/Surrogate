\title{Fits (univariate) fixed-effect models to assess surrogacy in the binary-binary case based on the Information-Theoretic framework}
\description{
The function \code{FixedBinBinIT} uses the information-theoretic approach (Alonso & Molenberghs, 2007) to estimate trial- and individual-level surrogacy based on fixed-effect models when both S and T are binary variables. The user can specify whether a (weighted or unweighted) full, semi-reduced, or reduced model should be fitted. See the \bold{Details} section below.   
}
\usage{
FixedBinBinIT(Dataset, Surr, True, Treat, Trial.ID, Pat.ID, 
Model=c("Full"), Weighted=TRUE, Min.Trial.Size=2, Alpha=.05, 
Number.Bootstraps=50, Seed=sample(1:1000, size=1))
}
\arguments{
  \item{Dataset}{A \code{data.frame} that should consist of one line per patient. Each line contains (at least) a surrogate value, a true endpoint value, a treatment indicator, a patient ID, and a trial ID.}
  \item{Surr}{The name of the variable in \code{Dataset} that contains the surrogate endpoint values.}
  \item{True}{The name of the variable in \code{Dataset} that contains the true endpoint values.}
  \item{Treat}{The name of the variable in \code{Dataset} that contains the treatment indicators. The treatment indicator should either be coded as \eqn{1} for the experimental group and \eqn{-1} for the control group, or as \eqn{1} for the experimental group and \eqn{0} for the control group. }
  \item{Trial.ID}{The name of the variable in \code{Dataset} that contains the trial ID to which the patient belongs.}
  \item{Pat.ID}{The name of the variable in \code{Dataset} that contains the patient's ID.}
  \item{Model}{The type of model that should be fitted, i.e., \code{Model=c("Full")}, \code{Model=c("Reduced")}, or \code{Model=c("SemiReduced")}. See the \bold{Details} section below. Default \code{Model=c("Full")}. }
\item{Weighted}{Logical. In practice it is often the case that different trials (or other clustering units) have different sample sizes. Univariate models are used to assess surrogacy in the information-theoretic approach, so it can be useful to adjust for heterogeneity in information content between the trial-specific contributions (particularly when trial-level surrogacy measures are of primary interest and when the heterogeneity in sample sizes is large). If \code{Weighted=TRUE}, weighted regression models are fitted. If \code{Weighted=FALSE}, unweighted regression analyses are conducted. See the \bold{Details} section below. Default \code{TRUE}.}
\item{Min.Trial.Size}{The minimum number of patients that a trial should contain to be included in the analysis. If the number of patients in a trial is smaller than the value specified by \code{Min.Trial.Size}, the data of the trial are excluded from the analysis. Default \eqn{2}.}
  \item{Alpha}{The \eqn{\alpha}-level that is used to determine the confidence intervals around \eqn{R^2_{h}} and \eqn{R^2_{ht}}. Default \eqn{0.05}.}
\item{Number.Bootstraps}{The standard errors and confidence intervals for \eqn{R^2_{h}}, \eqn{R^2_{b.ind}} and \eqn{R^2_{h.ind}} are determined based on a bootstrap procedure. \code{Number.Bootstraps} specifies the number of bootstrap samples that are used. Default \eqn{50}.}
\item{Seed}{The seed to be used in the bootstrap procedure. Default \eqn{sample(1:1000, size=1)}.}

\details{

\emph{Individual-level surrogacy}

The following univariate generalised linear models are fitted:

\deqn{g_{T}(E(T_{ij}))=\mu_{Ti}+\beta_{i}Z_{ij},}
\deqn{g_{T}(E(T_{ij}|S_{ij}))=\gamma_{0i}+\gamma_{1i}Z_{ij}+\gamma_{2i}S_{ij},}

where \eqn{i} and \eqn{j} are the trial and subject indicators, \eqn{g_{T}} is an appropriate link function (i.e., a logit link when binary endpoints are considered), \eqn{S_{ij}} and \eqn{T_{ij}} are the surrogate and true endpoint values of subject \eqn{j} in trial \eqn{i}, and \eqn{Z_{ij}} is the treatment indicator for subject \eqn{j} in trial \eqn{i}. \eqn{\mu_{Ti}} and \eqn{\beta_{i}} are the trial-specific intercepts and treatment-effects on the true endpoint in trial \eqn{i}. \eqn{\gamma_{0i}} and \eqn{\gamma_{1i}} are the trial-specific intercepts and treatment-effects on the true endpoint in trial \eqn{i} after accounting for the effect of the surrogate endpoint. 

The \eqn{-2} log likelihood values of the previous models in each of the \eqn{i} trials (i.e., \eqn{L_{1i}} and \eqn{L_{2i}}, respectively) are subsequently used to compute individual-level surrogacy based on the  so-called Variance Reduction Factor (VFR; for details, see Alonso & Molenberghs, 2007):

\deqn{R^2_{h}= 1 - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i} exp \left(-\frac{L_{2i}-L_{1i}}{n_{i}} \right),}

where \eqn{N} is the number of trials and \eqn{n_{i}} is the number of patients within trial \eqn{i}.

When it can be assumed (i) that the treatment-corrected association between the surrogate and the true endpoint is constant across trials, or (ii) when all data come from a single clinical trial (i.e., when \eqn{N=1}), the previous expression simplifies to:

\deqn{R^2_{h.ind}= 1 - exp \left(-\frac{L_{2}-L_{1}}{N} \right).}

The upper bound does not reach to 1 when \eqn{T} is binary, i.e., its maximum is 0.75. Kent (1983) claims that 0.75 is a reasonable upper bound and thus \eqn{R^2_{h.ind}} can usually be interpreted without paying special consideration to the discreteness of \eqn{T}. Alternatively, to address the upper bound problem, a scaled version of the mutual information can be used when both \eqn{S} and \eqn{T} are binary (Joe, 1989):

\deqn{R^2_{b.ind}= \frac{I(T,S)}{min[H(T), H(S)]},}

where the entropy of \eqn{T} and \eqn{S} in the previous expression can be estimated using the log likelihood functions of the GLMs shown above. %%%

\emph{Trial-level surrogacy}

When a full or semi-reduced model is requested (by using the argument \code{Model=c("Full")} or \code{Model=c("SemiReduced")} in the function call), trial-level surrogacy is assessed by fitting the following univariate models: 

\deqn{S_{ij}=\mu_{Si}+\alpha_{i}Z_{ij}+\varepsilon_{Sij},   (1)}
\deqn{T_{ij}=\mu_{Ti}+\beta_{i}Z_{ij}+\varepsilon_{Tij},   (1)} 

where \eqn{i} and \eqn{j} are the trial and subject indicators, \eqn{S_{ij}} and \eqn{T_{ij}} are the surrogate and true endpoint values of subject \eqn{j} in trial \eqn{i}, \eqn{Z_{ij}} is the treatment indicator for subject \eqn{j} in trial \eqn{i}, \eqn{\mu_{Si}} and \eqn{\mu_{Ti}} are the fixed trial-specific intercepts for S and T, and \eqn{\alpha_{i}} and \eqn{\beta_{i}} are the fixed trial-specific treatment effects on S and T, respectively. The error terms \eqn{\varepsilon_{Sij}} and \eqn{\varepsilon_{Tij}} are assumed to be independent.

When a reduced model is requested by the user (by using the argument \code{Model=c("Reduced")} in the function call), the following univariate models are fitted:

\deqn{S_{ij}=\mu_{S}+\alpha_{i}Z_{ij}+\varepsilon_{Sij},   (2)}
\deqn{T_{ij}=\mu_{T}+\beta_{i}Z_{ij}+\varepsilon_{Tij},   (2)}

where \eqn{\mu_{S}} and \eqn{\mu_{T}} are the common intercepts for S and T. The other parameters are the same as defined above, and \eqn{\varepsilon_{Sij}} and \eqn{\varepsilon_{Tij}} are again assumed to be independent.

When the user requested a full model approach (by using the argument \code{Model=c("Full")} in the function call, i.e., when models (1) were fitted), the following model is subsequently fitted:

\deqn{\widehat{\beta}_{i}=\lambda_{0}+\lambda_{1}\widehat{\mu_{Si}}+\lambda_{2}\widehat{\alpha}_{i}+\varepsilon_{i},   (3)}

where the parameter estimates for \eqn{\beta_i}, \eqn{\mu_{Si}}, and \eqn{\alpha_i} are based on models (1) (see above).  When a weighted model is requested (using the argument \code{Weighted=TRUE} in the function call), model (3) is a weighted regression model (with weights based on the number of observations in trial \eqn{i}). The \eqn{-2} log likelihood value of the (weighted or unweighted) model (3) (\eqn{L_1}) is subsequently compared to the \eqn{-2} log likelihood value of an intercept-only model (\eqn{\widehat{\beta}_{i}=\lambda_{3}}; \eqn{L_0}), and \eqn{R^2_{ht}} is computed based based on the Variance Reduction Factor (for details, see Alonso & Molenberghs, 2007):

\deqn{R^2_{ht}= 1 - exp \left(-\frac{L_1-L_0}{N} \right),}

where \eqn{N} is the number of trials. 

When a semi-reduced or reduced model is requested (by using the argument \code{Model=c("SemiReduced")} or \code{Model=c("Reduced")} in the function call), the following model is fitted:

\deqn{\widehat{\beta}_{i}=\lambda_{0}+\lambda_{1}\widehat{\alpha}_{i}+\varepsilon_{i},}

where the parameter estimates for \eqn{\beta_i} and \eqn{\alpha_i} are based on models (1) when a semi-reduced model is fitted or on models (2) when a reduced model is fitted. The \eqn{-2} log likelihood value of this (weighted or unweighted) model (\eqn{L_1}) is subsequently compared to the \eqn{-2} log likelihood value of an intercept-only model (\eqn{\widehat{\beta}_{i}=\lambda_{3}}; \eqn{L_0}), and \eqn{R^2_{ht}} is computed based on the reduction in the likelihood (as described above).
