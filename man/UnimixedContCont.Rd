Fits univariate mixed-effect models to assess surrogacy in the meta-analytic multiple-trial setting
 (continuous-continuous case)}
\description{
The function \code{UnimixedContCont} uses the univariate mixed-effects approach to estimate trial- and individual-level surrogacy when the data of multiple clinical trials are available. The user can specify whether a (weighted or unweighted) full, semi-reduced, or reduced model should be fitted. See the \bold{Details} section below.  Further, the Individual Causal Association (ICA) is computed.

\details{
When the full bivariate mixed-effects model is fitted to assess surrogacy in the meta-analytic framework (for details, Buyse & Molenberghs, 2000), computational issues often occur. In that situation, the use of simplified model-fitting strategies may be warranted (for details, see Burzykowski et al., 2005; Tibaldi et al., 2003).   

The function \code{UnimixedContCont} implements one such strategy, i.e., it uses a two-stage univariate mixed-effects modelling approach to assess surrogacy. In the first stage of the analysis, two univariate mixed-effects models are fitted to the data. When a full or semi-reduced model is requested (by using the argument \code{Model=c("Full")} or \code{Model=c("SemiReduced")} in the function call), the following univariate models are fitted:

\deqn{S_{ij}=\mu_{S}+m_{Si}+(\alpha+a_{i})Z_{ij}+\varepsilon_{Sij},}
\deqn{T_{ij}=\mu_{T}+m_{Ti}+(\beta+b_{i})Z_{ij}+\varepsilon_{Tij},} 

where \eqn{i} and \eqn{j} are the trial and subject indicators, \eqn{S_{ij}} and \eqn{T_{ij}} are the surrogate and true endpoint values of subject \eqn{j} in trial \eqn{i}, \eqn{Z_{ij}} is the treatment indicator for subject \eqn{j} in trial \eqn{i}, \eqn{\mu_{S}} and \eqn{\mu_{T}} are the fixed intercepts for S and T, \eqn{m_{Si}} and \eqn{m_{Ti}} are the corresponding random intercepts, \eqn{\alpha} and \eqn{\beta} are the fixed treatment effects for S and T, and \eqn{a_{i}} and \eqn{b_{i}} are the corresponding random treatment effects, respectively. The error terms \eqn{\varepsilon_{Sij}} and \eqn{\varepsilon_{Tij}} are assumed to be independent. 

When a reduced model is requested (by using the argument \code{Model=c("Reduced")} in the function call), the following two univariate models are fitted:

\deqn{S_{ij}=\mu_{S}+(\alpha+a_{i})Z_{ij}+\varepsilon_{Sij},}
\deqn{T_{ij}=\mu_{T}+(\beta+b_{i})Z_{ij}+\varepsilon_{Tij},} 

where \eqn{\mu_{S}} and \eqn{\mu_{T}} are the common intercepts for S and T (i.e., it is assumed that the intercepts for the surrogate and the true endpoints are identical in each of the trials). The other parameters are the same as defined above, and \eqn{\varepsilon_{Sij}} and \eqn{\varepsilon_{Tij}} are again assumed to be independent. 

An estimate of \eqn{R^2_{indiv}} is computed as \eqn{r(\varepsilon_{Sij}, \varepsilon_{Tij})^2}. 

Next, the second stage of the analysis is conducted. When a full model is requested by the user (by using the argument \code{Model=c("Full")} in the function call), the following model is fitted:

\deqn{\widehat{\beta}_{i}=\lambda_{0}+\lambda_{1}\widehat{\mu_{Si}}+\lambda_{2}\widehat{\alpha}_{i}+\varepsilon_{i},}

where the parameter estimates for \eqn{\beta_i}, \eqn{\mu_{Si}}, and \eqn{\alpha_i} are based on the models that were fitted in stage 1, i.e., \eqn{\beta_{i}=\beta+b_{i}}, \eqn{\mu_{Si}=\mu_{S}+m_{Si}}, and \eqn{\alpha_{i}=\alpha+a_{i}}. 

When a reduced or semi-reduced model is requested by the user (by using the arguments \code{Model=c("SemiReduced")} or \code{Model=c("Reduced")} in the function call), the following model is fitted:
\deqn{\widehat{\beta}_{i}=\lambda_{0}+\lambda_{1}\widehat{\alpha}_{i}+\varepsilon_{i},}

where the parameters are the same as defined above. 

When the argument \code{Weighted=FALSE} is used in the function call, the model that is fitted in stage 2 is an unweighted linear regression model. When a weighted model is requested (using the argument \code{Weighted=TRUE} in the function call), the information that is obtained in stage 1 is weighted according to the number of patients in a trial.  

The classical coefficient of determination of the fitted stage 2 model provides an estimate of \eqn{R^2_{trial}}.

\value{An object of class \code{UnimixedContCont} with components,
  \item{Data.Analyze}{Prior to conducting the surrogacy analysis, data of patients who have a missing value for the surrogate and/or the true endpoint are excluded. In addition, the data of trials (i) in which only one type of the treatment was administered, and (ii) in which either the surrogate or the true endpoint was a constant (i.e., all patients within a trial had the same surrogate and/or true endpoint value) are excluded. In addition, the user can specify the minimum number of patients that a trial should contain in order to include the trial in the analysis. If the number of patients in a trial is smaller than the value specified by \code{Min.Trial.Size}, the data of the trial are excluded. \code{Data.Analyze} is the dataset on which the surrogacy analysis was conducted.}
